/**
 * A collection is a grouping of products that merchants can create to make their stores easier to browse.
 * For example, a merchant might create a collection for a specific type of product that they sell, such as Footwear.
 * Merchants can create collections by selecting products individually or by defining rules that automatically determine whether products are included.
 *
 * Shopify stores start with a single collection, called Frontpage.
 * This is a collection of products that are shown on the front page of the online store.
 *
 * There are two different types of collection:
 *
 * Custom collections,
 * which contain products that are manually added to a collection by a merchant. For more information, see the CustomCollection resource.
 *
 * Smart collections,
 * which contain products that are automatically added based on selection conditions that a merchant chooses.
 * For more information, see the SmartCollection resource.
 * The Collect resource is used to connect a product to a custom collection.
